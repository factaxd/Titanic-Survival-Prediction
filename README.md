# Titanic Dataset Analysis Project

## Overview
This project uses the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle to analyze passenger data and predict survival rates. The Titanic dataset is one of the most popular datasets for beginning data science projects, containing information about passengers including their age, class, fare, and whether they survived.

## Dataset Description
The dataset is split into two CSV files:
- `train.csv`: Contains the training data with known survival outcomes
- `test.csv`: Contains the test data where we need to predict survival

### Features
- PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
- Survived: Whether the passenger survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st class, 2 = 2nd class, 3 = 3rd class)
- Name: Passenger name
- Sex: Passenger gender
- Age: Passenger age
- SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
- Ticket: Ticket number
- Fare: Passenger fare
- Cabin: Cabin number
- Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Source
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle's "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" competition:
[Titanic Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

## Project Goals
- Analyze passenger demographics
- Identify patterns in survival rates
- Build predictive models for survival
- Practice data cleaning and preprocessing
- Implement machine learning techniques
